{"0":"THE VAMPYRE;","1":"A Tale.","2":"By John William Polidori","3":"THEsuperstition upon which this taIe i\u017f founded is very general in the East. Among tho Arabjans itappeors to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establi shment of Christianity; and it has only a\u017fsumed its prosent form since the division af the Latin and Greok churches; at which time, lhe idea becoming prevalent, that a Lcltin body could not corrvpl if buried in their territory, it gradually increosed, and formed lhe subject of many wonderful stories, \u017ftill extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding uponlhe blood of tho young and beautiful. In the West itspread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the helies existed, that vompyresnightly imbi6ed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of c0nsumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened\u2014and their veins became distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their badies, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.","4":"In theLond0n Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to hove accurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief arid magistrates of tbe place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had bcen beclrd to say, that, at Cassovia, ori the fr0ntiers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the euj1, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyre's grove, and rubbing him\u017felf with his blood. This prccaution, however, did not prevent him from bccoming a vampyre him\u017fels; sor, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complainod of hauing 6een tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived os life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the lnhabitants havjng consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and f ound it (a\u017f is supposed to be usual in cafes of uampyrism) fresh, and entjrely free from corruptjon, and emitting at the rnouth, riose, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely lhrough the bearl and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to hauecried out cls dreadfully as is he had been olive. This done, they cut ofs his head, burned his body, and threw lhe asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of th ose persons who had previously dicd from varnpyrism, lest they should, in theirturn, become clgentf upan others who survived them.","5":"The universa1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, arid sucks in his turn.","6":"Chlef bai1iff.","7":"This monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems betler adapted to illustrate the subject of the prcsent o6servations than any other iristance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of pvnishment after doatb, for some hein ous crime commjtted whilst in existence, that the deceased is not anly doomed to vampyrise, but oompelled to confine bis infernal vjsitations solely to thofe beings he loved most while upon earth\u2014those to whom be was bound by ties of kindr od and affeclion.\u2014A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"","8":"But fir\u017ft on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy cor\u017fe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the natiue place, And suck thc blo0d of all thy race; There srom thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet l0atbe the banquet which perforee Must feed thy livid living cor\u017fe,Thy victims, ore they yet expirc, ShaIl know the demon for tbeir fire; As cvr\u017fing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowerf are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime musl fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name\u2014 That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel thou must end thy task and inark Her c heek's last tinge\u2014hor eye's last spark, And the last glassy glance must view Which freozes o'er its lifeless b1ue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear The tresses of her yellow hair, Of which, in life a lock wheri sborn Affcction's fondest pledge was worn\u2014 But now is borne away by thee Memorial of lhine agony! Yet with thine own bost blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and baggard lip; Then sta1king to thy sullen gravc, Go\u2014arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till thefe in horror shrjnk away From spcctre more accursed than they.","9":"Mr. Southey hcls also intraduced in his wild bul heavtiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vompyre corfe of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as havirig returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting hirn shc best loved whilst in exi\u017ftence.Bvt this cannot be supposed to havc resulted from the sinfulne\u017fs of her life, she being pourtrayed througbout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciou\u017f Tourncf0rt gives o long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he pretends to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his greot work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of jts effects, has put forth \u017fome learned dissertalions, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian errar.","10":"Many curious and intcresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; tbough the present may suffiee for the limjts of a note, nece\u017fsarily devoted to explanation, and which inay now be conc1uded 6y merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, thcre are scvercll others synonymous withit, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.","11":"THE VAMPYRE.","12":"IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the variovs partles af lhe leaders of the ton anobleman, inore rcmarkable for his singularitjes, thcln his ran k. He gazed upon the mirth arourid him, as if he could not partielpate therein. Apporently, the light laughter of the fair orily attracted his attention, that he might by a loak quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where th0ughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensalion of awe,could nat cxplajn whencc it arose: some attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, fixing upori the object's face, did nat seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the oheek with a leaden ray lhclt weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 be invited to every bou fe; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exciteinent, and now felt the weight af en nui, were pleased at having somelhing in their preserice capable of engaging their attentian. In spite of the deadly hue 0f his foce, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotion of passiori, lhough its form and outline were beautiful, many of thc fcmale hunters after natoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who bad been tbe mockery of euery monster shewn in drawing-rooms \u017fince her marriage, threw herse1f in his way, and did all but put an the dress of a mauntebank, to attract his not ice:\u2014thoughin vain:\u2014when fhe stood before him, though his eyes were apparonlly fixed upon her 's, \u017ftill it seemed as lf they were unperceived;\u2014evcn her unappalled iinpudonce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But though the comm0n adultress could not inflvence everi the guidancc of hi\u017f eyos, it was not that tbe female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was tho apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent davghter, that few knew hecver addressed himself to semaIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whelher it was that it even ouercarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as ofteri among those females who form the boast of thejr sex from their domestic virtues, as amang tho\u017fe who sully it by their vices.","13":"Ahout the \u017fame time, there cclme to Lond0n a yourig gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whlle he was yet jn childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it tbeir duty merely to take care of hls fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of mercenary suballerns, he cultivated more his imagination than hi\u017f judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feelirig of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with uirtue, and thought that vico was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the vcsting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to tho painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, jn sine, that the dreams os poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and rieh: for lhese reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers svrrounded bim,striving which shovld describe wlth least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daug-\nhter\u017f at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, whenbo opened his lips, s0on led him into false notions of his talenls and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram ance of hif solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndles that flickered, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in recll life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions coritained in those volumes, from whjch he had formed his study. Fjnding, however, some compensati0n in bis gratified vanity, he was aboul to reliriqvishhis dreams, when the extraordinary belng we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.","14":"He watched him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the charocler af a man entirely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaue few other signs of hif obseruation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of tbeir contact: allowing his irnagination t0 picture every thlng that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object inta the ber0 of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather thanthe persori besore him. He became acqv ainted with him, paid him atteritions, and so sar advanced upon his notice, that his presenco was alwoys recagnised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarrafsod, and soon found, from the notes of preparatlon in \u2014 Street, that he was about to travel. Desirou\u017f of gaining some informalion respeeling this \u017firigular character, who, till now, had orily whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, thot il was time for him to perform the taur, which for many gerierations has been tbougbl necessary to enoble lbe yaung to take some rapid steps in the career of uice towards putti ng themselves upon an equality with the oged, and not allowing them to appear as if falleri froin the skies,whenever scaridalovs intrigues are mentloned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pralse, accordlrig to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented: and Avbrey immediatcly mentioning bis intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla-\nttered by such a mark of estcem frorn him, who, apparently, had nolhing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed lhe circling waterf.","15":"Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and n0w he fovnd, that, though many more of bis actians were exposed to his viow, the results offered different concluslons from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse ln his liberality;\u2014the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, reeeived from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediale wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, lhat it was not upon the virluous, redvced ta iridigence by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuc, thal he beslowed his cllms;\u2014these were sent from lhe door with hardly suppressed sneers; 6ut when thc profligate carne lo ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him lo wallow in hjs lust, or to sink him sti1l deeper in his iniquily, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributedby him to the greater importunity of tho vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was ono circumstance about the charity 0f his Lordship, which was stlll more lmpresfed up0n his mind: all lhose upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found thot therewas a curse vpon it, for they were all either led to the seaffaId, or sunk to the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. At Brussels and othcr t owns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd at the apparent eagerness with whieh his companion sought for the eentres of all fashionable vicc; there he entered jnto allthc spirit af the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, exoept where the known sharper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari he gainod; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so wben he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckle\u017fs fclther of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law\u2014this apparent abstracledness of mind wcls Iaid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hal f-dead mouse. In every town, he left tbe formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cur\u017fing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sate that had drawn him within the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst many a father sat fraritic, clmidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immen\u017fe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to fcltisfy thelr present craving. Yet ho took no money from thc gambling table; bvt immediatoly lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conuulsive grasp of theinnooent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the more exp-\nerienoed. Aubrey often wisbed to represent tbj\u017f to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of aIl, and dld not terid to his own profit;\u2014but he delayed it\u2014for each day he h0ped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, tbis never occurrcd. Lord Ruthuen in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: hi\u017f eye spoke less than his lip; and thougb Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtajned no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of voinly wishing to break tbat rny\u017ftery, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assumo the appearance of something svpernalural.","16":"They s0on arrived ot Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendarice upon the morning circlc of an Italian countess, whilst he wenl in search of the memorials of another almost desertod cily. Whilst he wa\u017f thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first wos from his sister, breathing nothirig but affection; lhe others were from his gvardians, the latter astanished him; if it had hesore entered into his imagination that thcre was an evil power resident in his companion, these soemed to glve hjm sufficienl reason f0rthe belief. His guardians jnsisted upon his immedialely leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresjstible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discouered, that his contempt for the a dultress had not originated in hatred of hercharacter; but thot he had reqvired, to erihance his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be hurled from the pinnclcIe of vnsullicd virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and dogradation: in fine, thal all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, hod, since his departvre, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to tbe public gaze.","17":"Aubrey detcrmined upon leaving one, whose cbclracter had not yet shown a sjngle bright point on which t0 rest tbe eye. He refolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watcb him more closely, ond to let no slight circurnslances pass by unnotlced. He entered into the \u017fame cir cle, and soon percoived, that his Lordship was ondeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldam that an unmarried female is met with in socjety; he was theref0re obliged to oarry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye fallowedhim in all his windingf, and soon diseoverod that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would mosl likely ond in tho ruin af an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked hiin his intenlions wlth respect to the lady, informing him atthe same time that be was aware of his being about to meet her thal uery night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his inlentions were such as he supposed clll would have upon such an occasion; and upon b eing pressed wbether he intended to marry her, merely laughcd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram that moment he must declirie accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the remainder of tbeir proposed tour, he orderod his servarit to seek other apartments, and calling upon tho rnother of the lady, inf orined her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sont hi\u017f scrvant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion ofhis plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.","18":"Having lest Rome, Aubrey djrected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of anclent glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling thc deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden themsolves beneath the sheltering soil or many co1oured lichen. Under the same roof as hirnself, exlsted a being, so beautiful and delicate, thal she might have sormed the model for a pclinter wishing to pourtray on carivass tbe promised hope osthe saithful in Mahomet's parcldise, savothat her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typeof hcr becluties; for who would have exchangcd hcr eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurlous look of the animaI suited but to the taste of an epicure. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, sloatirig as it were upon the wind, to thc eager gazc of him, who forgot lhe letters he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosl effaced ta6let, in the contemplation of her sylph-Iike figure. Oflen would her tresses falIing, as she flitted around, exhibit in the s un's ray such delica tely brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antjquary, who lel escape from his mirid the very objecl he had before thaughl of vital importance to the proper interpretation os a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?\u2014It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stisling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preseruo a memorjaI for hls future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all thc glowing colours af youthsul memory,the marriage pomp \u017fhe remernbered viewing in her irifancy; and then, turning to subjoctsthat had evidentIy madc a greater impre\u017fsion upon her mjnd, would tell him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. Her earneslness and apparent belief of what she narratod, excited tho interest even of Aubrey; and oftenas she told him the tale of the living uampyre, wha had passed years amidst his fricnds, and dearest tles, forced every year, by feeding upon tbe life of a lovely semalc to prolong his existerice for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst be attempted to laugh her out of such id1e and horrible fantasles; but Ianthe citedto him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children hod been found marked with lhe stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found hirn so incredulous, she begged of him to bclieve her, sor it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, alway\u017f had some proof giveri, which obljged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to con fess it was trve.She detailed to him the traditional appearance os these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description os Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, \u017ftill persisted in persuclding her, that thore could 6e na truth in her fears, though at the same tirne he wondcred at the mariy coiricidencos which had all tended to excjte a belief in tho supernatural power of Lord Ruthuen.","19":"Aubrey began to attoch himself more clnd more to Ianthe; her innoeence, so contrasted with all the affccted virtues of the women among whom he had sovght f0r bis visiori of romance, won his heart; and whlle he ridjculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to lhe almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself ottimes fr0m her, and, forming a plan for sorne antiquarian reseclrch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object wos attained; but he always fourid it lmpofsible to fix his attention upori the rvins around him, whi1st in his mind he retained an irnoge that seemed aIone the rightful possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insantile being he had first known. She always seemed to pclrt from him witb roluclarice; but it was becaufe she had rio longer any one with whom sbe could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some sragmenl which bad yet escapcd the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeaIed ta her parents on the subject of Vampyres, andthey both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror at the very name. Soori after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursion\u017f, which was to detain him sor a few hours; when they beard the name of the pla ce, thoy all at once be gged of him not to retvrn at night, as he must nocessarily pasf through a wood, where noGreek would ever remain, aster the day bad closed, vpon any con\u017fideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced lhe most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey rnade light of their representations, and tried to lavgh them out of lhe idea; bul when he saw them shudder at his darjng thus to mock a superiar, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.","20":"Next m0rriing Aubrey set off upon his exoursian unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of bis host, and was concerned to sind lhat his words, mocking the bolief of those horri6le fiends, had lnspired them with fuch terror. When he was about to depart, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly hegged os him to returri, ere night allowed the power os these boirigs to be put in action;\u2014he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, thal he did not perceive tbat doy-light would soon ond, and that ln the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer cllmates, so rapidIy gather into a tremendous mass, and paur aIl their rage upon the devoted country.\u2014He at last, bowever, mounted his horse, determined to mako up by speed for his delay: hut it waf too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost vnknown; immediate1y tho sun sets, night begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the starm wclf above\u2014lts echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest\u2014its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliago, whilst thc blue f0rked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hi\u017f uery feet. Suddenly his horse toak srighl, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity througb the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, clnd he found, 6y the glare of lightning, that he was iri the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead lcaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouriting, he approachcd, hoping to find some one to guide him to the t0wn, or at lcast trusting to obtain sheltor from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the lhunders, fora moment silenl, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery os a laugh, contjnued iri one almost unbroken sound;\u2014he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced operi the door os the hut. He f0und himsclf in utter darkness: the sound, h0wever, guidedhim. He was apparently vnperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of bim. He found himself in c0n tacl with some one, whom he jmmediately \u017feized; when a uoice cried, \"Again baffled!\" t0 which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his Iife cls dearly as he could, he struggled; but it wcls in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:\u2014his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon hisbreast, had pIaced bis hands upon his thraat\u2014when thc glare of mony torches penetrating through the hole thclt gave light in the day, disturbod him;\u2014he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cl momenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke throvgh the wood, was rio longer heard. Thc st0rm was now stiIl; and Aubrey, incapable os moving, was soon heard by those wilbout. They entered; tbe light of their torches fell upon the mvd wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; bvt what waf his horror, when the lighl of tbe torches once mare burst upon hiin, to perceive the airy form of hls fair conductress br0ught in a lifeless corse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was 6ut a visjon arisirig from hls disturbed imagination; but he again saw tbe same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet th ere was a stillness abaut her foce that seemed almost as ottaching as the life that once dwelt there:\u2014upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:\u2014to this the men pointed, crying, simvltaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! a Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickIy formed, and Au6rey waslaid by the side of her who had lately been to him thc objeot of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dled within her. He knew nol whot his thoughts were\u2014his mirid was benumbed and seemcd to shun reflection, and take refvge in vacancy\u2014he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in thc hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engagedjn the search of ber wham a mother had missod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful cotastrophe. \u2014To describe their grlef would be impossible; but whenthey ascertained the cause 0f their child'f death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointcd to the corse. They were inconsolable; botb died br0ken-hearted.","21":"Aubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a most vialent fever, and was often delirjovs; inthe\u017fe intervals he would ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and upon Ianthe\u2014hy some unaccountable combination he seemed la beg of his former compclnion to sparo the being hc loved. At other times he would imprecote maledictionsupon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. L0rd Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive al Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, andbecame his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrisjed and startled at the sight of hlm whose image he had now com6ined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his klnd words, iinplying cllmost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care whichhe showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His 1ordship seemed quile changed; he na longer appeared that apathetic being who had \u017fo astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his eonvalescerice began to he rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mirid, and Aubrey perceiued no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon hirn, wilh a smi1e of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo hau-\nntcd him. During the last \u017ftage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was clppclrently engaged in watohing the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, 1ike our world, the moveless fun;\u2014lndeed, he appeared to wish to av0id tbe eyef of all.","22":"Aubrcy's mind, by this sbock, was much weokened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of \u017folitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind couId nat find it in tbe neighbourhood of At hens; if he sought it amidsl the ruins hehad formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side\u2014if he sought it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amldst the underwood, jn quest of the m0dest violet; then sudderily turning rovnd, would show, to hls wild imagination, her pale face and wounded lhroat, with a meek smile vpon her lips. Ho determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crcated such bitter associcltions in hif mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he heId himself bound hy the tender cclre he had taken af him during his illness, that tbey sbouId visit those parts of Greecc neilher had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to whicb o recollectjon covId be attaohed: but thougb they thus haslened from place to place, yet they seomed not ta heed what they gazed upon. Tbcy heard much of robbers, but they gradually begari to slight thesc reports, which they jmagined were only the invention of individvals, whosc interest it was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence af thus rieglceting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasiori they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, wilh large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiees, they had reason t0 repent their negligence; for scarccly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the cchoed report of sevcral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind rocks, had hegun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, retired for a moment behjnd the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting fhouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the r0bbers should climb above and take lhom in the rear, they determlned at once to rush forward jn search of the enemy. Hardly had they loft the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the grourid. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contcst or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him\u2014bis guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, imrnediately thrown up their arms and surrendored.","23":"By promises of greal reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded fricnd to a neighbouring cabin; arid having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence\u2014they being content merely to guard the enlrance till their comrade should return with the pr0mised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthuen's \u017ftrengthrapidly deoreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advanoing with hasty steps. His coriduct and appeorance had not chonged; he seomed as unconscious of pain as he bad been of the objeets about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, andhis eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his asfistanoe with mare than usucll earnestness\u2014\"Assist me! you may save me\u2014you may do more than that\u2014I mean not my life, I heed the death of my exj\u017ftence a\u017f liltle as that of the passirig day; but you may save my honour, your friend's hanour.\"\u2014\"How? lell me how? I would do any thirig,\" roplied Aubrey.\u2014\"I need bul little\u2014my life ebbs apace\u2014I eannot explain thc whole\u2014but if you would conceal all yau know os ine, rny honour were free from stain in the world's mouth\u2014and if my death were un kriown for some time in England\u2014I\u2014I\u2014but life.\"\u2014\"It shaIl not be known.\"\u2014\"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exvltant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year anda day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any woy, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. \"\u2014Hif eyes se omed burstingfrom their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, arid breathed no more.","24":"A ubrey retired to rest, but did not slcep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintoriee with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered hls ooth a cold shivering came 0ver him, as if from the presentiment of something horrl6le awaiting him. Rising earIy in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri which he hcld left the corpse, when a robbcr met him, and informed himthat it was no 1ongcr there, having been c0nveyed by himself orid comrades, upon hif retiring, lo the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, aecording to a promife they hcld given his lordship, thal it should he exposed to the first cold ray of tho moon thatrose ofter his declth. Aubrey aftonished, and taking several of lhe men, determined to go and bvry it upon the spot where it Iay. But, wben be had mounted to lhe summit he sound no trace of either lhe corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicol rock on which they bad laid the b0dy. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that tbey had buried the corp\u017fe for the sake of the cl0lhes.","25":"Weary of a courilry in which he had met with \u017fuch terrible mjsfortunes, and iri which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melanchoIy that had seized upon his mind, he res olved l0 leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to canvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceupied himsels in arranging those effects he had with him belongjng to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning tbem over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in tbo same style as the dogger di\u017fcovered in the fatal hvt\u2014he shuddcred\u2014ha\u017ftening to gain furtber proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror may be imagjned when he discovered that it fitted, though pocuIiarly shaped, the sheatb he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty\u2014they seemed ga2ing to be bound to lhe dagger; yct stilI he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon lhe haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for d oubt; there were also drops of blood on each.","26":"He left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Ro me, his fjrst inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and sbe had nat been heard of since lbe departuro of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almostbroken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid lhat this lady had fallen a victiin to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted jn urging lhe speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which \u017feemed abedierit to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and hc hostened to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantinc caresses, had gainod his affection, now that the woman began to appear, sbe was still more attaching as a companion.","27":"Miss Aubrey had riot that winnlng grclce wbich gains the gaze and appIause of tbe drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of thclt light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blve oye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm ab0ut it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, bvl from some feelirig within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was riot that light sooting, which strays whero'er a butterfly ora colour may attract\u2014it was sedate and pensive. When alorie, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her br0ther breat-\nhed to her his affect ion, and would in her presence forget lhase griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her fmile for that os the uoluptvary? It seemod as if those eyes,\u2014that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had nat been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should 6e delayed untiI her brother's returri fromthe continent, when he might be hcr protector. It was now, therefore, resoIved thclt the next drawing-room, which was fastapproaching, should be the epoch of ber entry into the \"bu\u017fy scene.\" Aubrey would rather bave reinained in the mansion os his fathers, and fed up0n the ineIancboly which overpowered him. He could not feel interesl about the frlvolities of fashionable strongers, when bis mind had been so torri by the events he had witnessod; but he determined to sacrifice hls own comfort to the protectjon of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared f0r the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.","28":"Tbe crowd was excessive\u2014a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and al1 who were clnxious to bask in the s mile of royally, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While ho was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all araund him, cngaged in tho remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very plaoe\u2014he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his eor\u2014\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage t0 turn, fearfuI of seeing a spectre that would blast hjm, when he perceiued, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice ori this spot upon his first entry into so cicty. He gozed till hls limb\u017f almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a pa\u017fsage through the crowd, he threw himself irito his carriage, and wos driven home. Hc paced thc room with hurried steps, and fixcd his hands upon bis head, as jf he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him\u2014circumstances star-\nted up in dreadfvl array\u2014the dagger\u2014bis oath.\u2014He roused himsels, he could nal believe it possible\u2014the dead rise agoin!\u2014He thought his imaginalion had conjured up the image hif mirid was rest-\nirig upon. It was impofsible that it couId be real\u2014he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attemptod to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurig vpon his lips, and he eauld not succecd in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection os a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave hiinself up ta his own devouring thovghts.Pcrceiving, at last, that many were leaving, ho roused him\u017felf, and entering another room, found his sister furrounded by several, apparently in earnest canversalion; he attemptod to pass and get near her, when one, wbom he requested to move, tvrned round,and reveoled lo him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sjster'sarm, and, with hurried step, forcod her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting f0r their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, be again heard that voico whisper eIose to him\u2014\"Remember your oalh!\"\u2014He did not darcto turn, but, hurrying his sister, soori reached home.","29":"Au6rey became cllmost distracted. If befare his mind had been ab\u017forbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engro\u017fsed, now that the certainty of the inonster's 1iving again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain thal she intrcated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt condu ct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, tbe more he was bewildered. His aath startled him;\u2014was he thcn to allow this monster to roam, beclring ruin upon his breath, ainidst all he held dear, and not avert its progrefs? His very sister mlght hclve been tauched by hlm. But euen if be were to break his oath, and disclose bif suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing bis own hand to free the world fram such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days ho remained in this state; shut up in his room,hc fow no one, and ate only when his \u017fister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stil1ness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from streot to stroet, anxious to fly that image whioh haunted hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to lhe midnight damps. He was no langer to 6e recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him downto rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safoly, employed people to follow him; butthey were soon distonced by him who fled from a pursuer swister than any\u2014from thought. His conduct, however, sudderily chariged. Struck with the idea thal ho left by his absence tho whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence tbey were unconscious, he determined to cnter agoin into society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when heentered into a room, hls haggard and suspicious looks were so st riking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstclin from seeking, for her sake, cl society which offected hlm so strongly. When, however, remon\u017ftrance proved vnavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust whjch had boen bofore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.","30":"Desirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had dai ly encountered in hls wanderings, and of preventirig him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what tbey considered folly, they engaged aphysician to reside iri tbe house, and take conslant care of him. He hard1y appeared to notice it, so completely was bis mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherenee beeame at laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he wovld often lie for days, incapable af being roused. He had become emaciated, his cyes had attained a glassy lustrc;\u2014the only sign of afsecti0n and recollection remaining displayed itself upon tho enlry of hissister; then hc would sometirnes start, and, sejzing her hands,with looks thal severely afflicted her, he would dosire her not to touch hirn. \"Oh, do not touch him\u2014if your loue for me is aught, do riot go rieor him!\" Wben, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he \u017fank jnto a state, wbence riot even she could rouse him. Thif lasted many months: gradually, however, as the yeclr was passing, his incoherenees became less frequent, and hi\u017f mind tbrew off a portion of its gloom, whil\u017ft his guardians observed, thal severcll t imes in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numher, and tben smile.","31":"The lime had nearly elapscd, when, up0n the lclst day of the year, one of his guardians enterlng his raom, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrcy's being in so awfu1 a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. InstantlyAubrey's attenlion was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of whlch tbey feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking thif was a young Earl whom he had met with in sociely, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing bis iritontiori to be presenl at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sist er. They answered not, but in a few minutes his fister was with him. He was apparcntly again capable of being asfected by the influence of her lovely smiIe; for he pressed her tohis breast, and kissed her cheek, wot with tears, fl0wing at the thought of her brolher's bejng once more alive to tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmlh, and to congratvlate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank arid euery accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprjse at beholding the features of the monster who had so long inf1uenced his life. He seized tbe portrait ln a paroxysm of rage, and trampIed jt under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand her\u2014then \u017feizing her hands, arid gazing on her with a srantic expression of countcriance, he badeher swear thatshc would never wed this monster, for he\u2014 But he could not advance\u2014it seemed as if tbat voice again bade hirn rememberhis oath\u2014he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard lhe whole, and thought this wcls but a return of his disorder, ent-\nered, and sorcing him from Miss Aub rey, desired hcr to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, be begged of them to deIay but for one day. They, attrjbvting thisto the insanjty they imagined had taken possession of hls mind, endeovaured to pocify him, and rctired.","32":"Lord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had beon refused with every one else. Wheri he heard of Aubrey'\u017f ill hecllth, he readily understood himself ta be the cause os it; but wheri he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation andpleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had gained this informatjon. Ho hastoned to the house 0f his former companion, and, by coristant attendance, and the pretence os great offection for the brother and intorest in his fale, he graducl1ly wori the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resisl his power? Hi\u017f t0ngue had dangers and toils to recovnt\u2014could speak of himse1f as of an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the crowded earth, save wlth her lo whom he addressed himself;\u2014could tell how, since he knew ber, his exislonce, hadbegun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely tbat he might listen ta her soothirig aocents;\u2014in fine, he knew so woll how to use the serpent's art, orsuch was the will of fate, tbat ho gained her affeotions. The title of the elder 6ranch falling at length to him, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse for hasteningthe marriage, (in spito of her brother's deranged state,) wbich wa\u017f to take place the very day before hls departure for the contincnt.","33":"Aubrey, when he was lefl by the physician and his guardians, atlempled lo bribo the servclnts, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; hewrote a letter to his sister, coniuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own boriour, and the hon0ur of tho\u017fe now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for o fow hovrs that rnarriage, on which hc den0unced the mosl heavy curses. The servonts promised they would deIiver it; bul giving lt to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates os the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the nates os busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrcy grew almost franlic. Thc curiosity of the servants at last overcame thejr vigilance, thoy graduolly slole away, leaving hirn in the custody of an helpless old womari. He seized the apportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a rnoment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, takinghis arm hy force, hurried hlm from the ro0m, speechless with rage. When on the ftaircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear\u2014\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6ride ta day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So fclying, he pushed him towards his atlend ants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no loriger support hiinself; his ragenat firiding vent, had broken a blood-ves\u017fel, and he was c0nveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, whowas not present when he eritered, as the physician waf afraid of agitatirig her. The marriage was solcmnized, and tbe bride and bridegroom left London.","34":"Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion 0f blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his \u017fisler's guardians might bo called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related c0mposedly what the reader haf perused\u2014he died immediately after.","35":"The gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but wben they arrived, it was too 1 ate. Lord Ruthven had disclppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thjrst of a VAMPYRE!","36":"EXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.","37":"ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.","38":"\"Tbe world was alI beforehim, where to chaose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"","39":"IN Sailing through the Greeian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 18I2, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certcliri supply of cattle and vegetables always to 6e had there, induce many British vessels lo visit it\u2014both men of war and merchontmen; and tbough it lies rather out of lhe tra ck for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviotion of a voyage. We landed; as usua1, at the boltom of thc bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myse1f to0k a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small monticuIe so named) we mct witb and engclged a young Greek as ovr guide, who told us he hcld come from Scio with an English lord, wbo lest the islarid sour days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pjlot,\" said tbe Greek, \"andwould have taken me with him; but I did not choose to qvit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was anodd, bvt a very good man. The cottage over the hil1, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he has left an old mcln in cbclrge of it: ho gave Dominick, the wlne-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has reslded there about fourteen months, though not constant1y; for he sa ils in his felucca very 0ften to the differont is1ands.\"","40":"This account excitedour cvriosity very mueh, and we lost no time in hastening tothe house whore our countryrnan had resjded. We were kindly recejved by an old man, who conducted us ouer the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor\u2014an entrclnce hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlovr, and a6ed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rnarble tablcs on ejther side, a large myrtle ln the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which couId be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in tbe side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairf, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread an the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow\u2014the common bed throughout Greece. In tho sitling-ro0m we obscrved a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, fiIled with books and papers, which were then in a lclrge seaman's chest jn the closel: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contcnts. Ori the tablet os the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed at Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English book of any description. Most of those book\u017f were filled with marginal notes,written wlth a pencil, in Italian ond Latin. The Messiah was lilerally scri6bled all over, and marked wilh slips of paper, on whioh alsa were remark\u017f.","41":"The old man said: \"The lord had bcen reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there thcy must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to rnove one thing without orders, he would frown upon rne for a week together; hcis oth erways very good. I oncedid him a service; and I have the produce of tbis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechin es which I pay t0 an aged Arrnenian who rcsldes in cl small cottage in the wood, and whom lhe lord brought bero from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"","42":"The appearanee of the house externally wa\u017f pleasjng. The portico ln frorit was fifly paces Iong and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars witb 6lack pljnths and fret-work cor nices, (as it is now customary jn Grecian architecture,) were confiderably bigher lhan the roos. The roof, surroundedby a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tvrkey earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most os thc housc-tops are thuf furni\u017fhed, af upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.","43":"On the left hand as we enlered the house, a srnall streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on it\u017f borders, and under thc shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed mariy of his evenings ond nlghts till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sclid the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devo-\nut, \"and always attended our churcb twice a week, besjdes Sundays.\"","44":"The view fr0m this seat wcls what may 6etermed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye ta Mount CalcIa, coverod witb olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on lhe summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestio decay. A fmall stream issuing from the ruins descended in brokencascades, untjl il wos losl iri the woads noarthe mouritain's base. The sea smooth as g1ass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, lhrough a vista oflofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands werc distinotly observed, \u017ftuddjng the light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a vjew more tban I djd this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person wh0 had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wha had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Armeniari,\" said ovr c0nductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he wlll not,\"\u2014\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I\u2014\"If I con,\" sald he, \"I dare not.\" We had not tirne to vlsit the Armenian, 6ut on ovr return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. Ho hod portioned eight young girlswhen he was la\u017ft vpon tbe lsland, and oven danced with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, ond cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a newboat for a fishermari who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to tho paor children. In \u017fhort, he appeared to us, from all we coIlected, to have been a very ecoentric and benevoIent character. Ono circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at thc c otlage thought proper not to disolose. He had a most beautiful daugbter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the sea-sbore, and he hod bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.","45":"Such wa\u017f the information with which we departed from the peaeeful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on tbe rack, guessjng who this rambler iri Greece cavld be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and alI those eccenlrioities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our dovhtf were dispelled. FaIlingin compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt andGreece, \"The indivjdual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I mel him in my travols on the ifland of Tenedos, arid I al\u017fo visited hirn at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordsbip's fame, as we bad been some years fram home; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put into our hond\u017f we recognized the recluse of Calcla in overy page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we corisolcd ourselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never retum. I make thls statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordsbip's good riame, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dcscribcd as of an unfeeling dlsposition, avcrse to associatjng with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its forrows, or add lo jts pIeasures. Tbe fact is directly tho reverse, o\u017f may be plalrily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feolings of the heart, sa elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of \u017folitude is an additional reason for marking hjm cls a being on whosc heart Reljgion bath set her seal, and over whosehead Benev0lence hath thrown her inontle. No man can rcad the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a eountryman. With respect to his loves or pleasuros, I do not assume a right to give an oplnion. Reports are ever tobe received with caut-\nion, pclrticularly wheri directed against man'\u017f moral integrity; arid be wbo dares juslify bimself beforc that awful tribunal where all must appear, cllone may censure the errors os a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good insecret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony 0f a virtuous heart andself-approving conscierice.","46":"THE END","47":"GiIlet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street."}
