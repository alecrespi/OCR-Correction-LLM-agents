    "7": "VII.\nGeppetto returns home, giving the burattino his breakfast that the poor man had brought for him. The poor Pinocchio, who always had his eyes closed, did not see his feet yet. Just then he heard his father's voice, jumping down from the chair to run after the stick. But instead of two or three attempts, he fell flat on the floor. And when he beat the ground, it made the same noise as if it was going up five floors. - \"Open me!\" shouted Geppetto from the street. - \"Babbo mio, I can't...\" replied the burattino crying and rolling on the ground. - \"Why not?\" - \"Because they ate my feet,\" said Pinocchio, seeing the cat playing with some wooden toys. - \"Open me, please!\" cried Geppetto again. - \"Babbo mio, I can't...\" - replied the burattino crying and rolling on the ground. - \"I can't stand anymore, believe me. Oh! Poor me, poor me, that will be what I have to walk around with my knees for the rest of my life.\" - Geppetto thought that this was another trick of the burattino. He decided to finish it off. Climbing up the wall, he entered the house through the window. From the beginning, he wanted to say something and wanted to do something, but when he saw his Pinocchio lying on the floor without feet, he felt angry. And immediately he put his hand on his neck and kissed him and gave him many strokes and hugs. With his eyebrows falling down, he said: - \"Pinocchio my dear! How did you burn your feet? - \"I don't know, brother, but believe me, it was a terrible night, and I'll remember it forever. It sounded, danced, and I had a great hunger, and then the Grillo speaker said: \"It's good, you're bad and you deserve it.\" And I replied: \"Grillo, listen! - \"And he said: \"You're a burattino and your head is wood.\" And I grabbed his arm with a hammer, and he died, but the blame was mine because I didn't want to kill him. Try it yourself, I've put a piece of coal on the fire, but the mouse ran out and said: \"Arrivedida, etc., etc.\" And the hunger grew every day, so that old man with the night hat looked at me and said: \"Do it under and take your hair.\" And I took that cat's water on my head, because asking for bread isn't a shame, is it? I went back to the house right away, and since I always had a great hunger, I put my feet on the hot iron to warm myself, and you came back, and I found them burned, and meanwhile the hunger never stopped! - \"Oh! Oh! Oh! - \" - The poor Pinocchio started crying and hugging himself so hard that they could hear them from five kilometers away. - Geppetto, who understood everything that happened, realized one thing only, that the burattino felt dying from hunger, so he took out three peaches from his bag, and gave them to him saying: - \"These three peaches were my breakfast, but I give them to you willingly. Eat, and good food will be given to you. - \" (If you want to eat them, let me taste them.) - \"Suck them? - \" Repplied Geppetto amazed. - \"Never! In this world, from childhood, we must learn to eat everything, because we never know what will happen. Cases are everywhere! ... - \" - \"You're right, brother,\" said Pinocchio. - \"But I won't eat any fruit that hasn't been cut. I can't bear it. - \" - \"Oh! Yes, I'm right too! Cases are everywhere! ... - \" - \"That's true, brother,\" said Pinocchio. - \"But I won't eat anything until I get these peaches.\" - Then he began to chew slowly. At first, he opened his mouth slightly, but then he spread it wide open, and threw all the peaches into the air. After the peaches, he threw the torsos of the peaches and the iron pieces. When he finished eating everything, he hugged his body with his hands and said: - \"Now I feel well!\" - \"Yedi, therefore, \" said Geppetto, \"that I was right when I told you that you shouldn't overthink about food too much or too little. My dear, you never know what will happen in this world. Cases are everywhere! ... - \" - \"You're right, brother,\" said Pinocchio. - \"But I won't eat anything until I get these peaches.\" - Then he began to chew slowly.
